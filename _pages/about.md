Welcome to my website! I am JK Subramony. I am a first year student in the PhD program in Linguistics at the University of Southern California. 

My interests lie at the intersection of experimental and theoretical linguistics. I am interested in understanding how people process long distance dependencies and argument structure, and I primarily work with Malayalam. My interests also branch into understanding how the functional categories in the verbal spine of Malayalam are arranged, as well as analyzing the structure of the progressive nominals in the language.

Although Malayalam has been the primary language I have worked with, to date, I am equally fascinated by issues in other languages at the crossroads of morphology, syntax, and semantics.
